__ SHORT TERM __
find light sensor
find fire sensor
use buzzer?






__ project componets needed or desiered __
water sensor
mousture sensor
servo for water control()
motor for fan usage (29)
3 watt led
tempature & humidity sensor
    make humid adaptive to run water
LCD screen for screening
bumper sensor for making sure tray is installed
keypad for selecting mode/ entering input
fire sensor ? 
light sensor ?  
    maybe use photoresistive element (26)
buzzer for alarm?



ADAM: 
# keypad for selecting mode/ entering input
LCD screen for screening



DANMAN:
# servo for water control
# motor for fan usage
# LCD output
# moist sensor

LOGIC
------
if (light_sense < 2) -> light on 
if ( soil_moisture < 5%) -> turn servo to open water valve && reset moist_time
        if ((current_timer - moist_timer) < 1000)

if ( bump == 'true') -> plant tray empty
if (humid == 'true') -> turn on motor (fan)





__ documentation 
todo __
explain that servo is connected to water valve to turn it on
